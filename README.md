  

## To Start
Before you start, make sure you are able to connect to a Ziti Edge Controller. To learn more about Ziti constructs and API's go to: https://openziti.io/docs/reference/developer/api/

To build and run the application from source, you'll also need the following developer tools installed and available on your command line:

| Tool        | Version |
| :---:       | :---:   |
| Angular CLI | 16.x   |
| Node.js     | 16.3.x | 
| npm         | 8.1.x   |


## Running via Docker
The ZAC application can be run in a docker container by following the steps below.

If you don't have docker installed, you can download and install the docker engine here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/


### Build the Docker Image
From project root:
1. build the image: `docker build . -t openziti/zac`


### Running The Classic ZAC application
1. run: (sudo may/may not be necessary) 
	```
	sudo docker run -d --name zac -p 1408:1408 openziti/zac
	```

2. optional - add TLS: 
 
        sudo docker run -d \
            --name zac \
            -p 1408:1408 \
            -p 8443:8443 \
            -v "path-to-server.key":/usr/src/app/server.key \
            -v "path-to-server.chain.pem":/usr/src/app/server.chain.pem \
            openziti/zac 

### Running The Angular ZAC application with node API integration
* If you plan to connect to an Edge Controller that is NOT configured with a trusted SSL/TLS certificate, it's recomended you use the Node API integration
* To do this via **docker** run the container with the `node-api` argument:
```
sudo docker run -d --name zac -p 1408:1408 openziti/zac node-api
```

### Running The Angular ZAC application with edge API integration
* If your Edge Controller does use a trusted SSL/TLS certificate, you can access it from the console with the Edge API integration
* To do this via **docker** run the container with the `edge-api` argument:
```
sudo docker run -d --name zac -p 1408:1408 openziti/zac edge-api
```




## Running OpenZitiConsole From Source

### Running Classic App (pure html/javascript)

1) Install project dependencies
	```
	npm install --legacy-peer-deps
	```

2) Host the app by running the node server
	```
	node server.js
	```
 
3) Access the app @ http://localhost:1408


### Running the ZAC Angular App
* Make sure you have the angular CLI installed
* This project is currently running on angular 16.2.11
* To install the angular CLI run:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli@16.0.0-next.0
```

* You'll also need to be running Node JS version >= 16.13.x

From the project root: 

1) install project dependencies:
	```
	npm install --legacy-peer-deps
	```

2) build core project library
	```
	ng build ziti-console-lib
	```

3) build & run the ziti-console app 

	  a) In most cases, ff you plan on running the application in a local environment, you'll want to build & run the angular app with the node-api integration via:
   	  ```
	  ng build ziti-console-node
	  ```
	  ```
	  node server.js node-api
	  ```

	  b) If you plan to connect directly to an Edge Controller via HTTPS with a trusted TLS/SSL certificate, you can use the edge-api integration by building & running
	  ```
	  ng build ziti-console
   	  ```
   	  ```
	  node server.js edge-api
	  ```

5) Access the app @ http://localhost:1408


## Developing Angular App
There are two elements to the Angular app - 

From project Root:

1) Install dependencies
	```
	npm install --legacy-peer-deps
	```
	
2) The NPM library is referenced/linked in package.json as "ziti-console-lib": "file:dist/ziti-console-lib".
   This library includes the pure javascript code it shared with ziti-console, and Angular code it shares with other apps.

3) Run & watch changes in the core library in **ziti-console-lib**
	```
	ng build ziti-console-lib --watch
 	```
 
4) Then in a seperate window run & watch changes in the main application **app-ziti-console**
   	```
	ng serve ziti-console
	```

This ensures changes made to the NPM library get pulled into the Angular app you are developing

### Hybrid App
In the interim, the ziti-console project is a hybrid app, in that it runs the classic ZAC code (pure HTML/JS) together with tranisitoned angular components.
This requires some duplication - for instance in running both the classic settings and the ziti-console settings.
